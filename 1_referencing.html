<!-- to add css and html the above mentioned two methods can be used . .css  is used a css file.It is case sensitive so while linking a css file to html file one must consider
the case. -->
<!-- the second one is not used  -->
<!-- inline is applied directly to element but people dont use it as more as external ones
since applying the inline to all all elements is hard -->
<!-- internal css is where the css functions are added in html file instead of cresting another css file, by using<style>. -->
