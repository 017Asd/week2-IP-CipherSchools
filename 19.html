        Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, 
        and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence 
        displayed by animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include 
        speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as 
        well as other mappings of inputs. The Oxford English Dictionary of Oxford University
        Press defines artificial intelligence as:[1]
        the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally 
        require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making,
        and translation between languages.
        AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation systems
        (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
        self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level 
        in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[2] As machines become increasingly capable, 
        tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a
        phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] For instance, optical character recognition is frequently
        excluded from things considered to be AI,[4] having become a routine technology.[5]
