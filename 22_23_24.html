    <p>AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google), recommendation
       systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as 
       Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing 
       at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).[2] As machines become
       increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the 
       definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.[3] For instance, optical character 
       recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI,[4] having become a routine
        technology.[5]
